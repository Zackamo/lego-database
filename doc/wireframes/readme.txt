Our site will have a standard table/filter/search setup with the search bar having a slightly
diminished presence to emphasize filtering and sorting. We show one of three expected pages that will
display sets, pieces, and minifigs. They will have nearly identical structure, varying only in their
search, filter and results fields. Links between pages will allow the user to see the collection of
items represented by “number of” fields. We also expect our about page to link to the initial data
source and briefly explain site functionality.
